# 🗄️ Create Supabase Tables - Instructions

## Quick Steps to Create Tables

### 1. Open Supabase Dashboard
- Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
- Select your project: `dbjaogpesmyrqjwtzzwr`

### 2. Open SQL Editor
- Click **"SQL Editor"** in the left sidebar
- Click **"New query"**

### 3. Copy and Paste SQL
- Open the file: `supabase-tables.sql`
- Copy the entire contents
- Paste into the SQL Editor
- Click **"Run"** button

### 4. Verify Tables Created
- Go to **"Table Editor"** in Supabase
- You should see these tables:
  - ✅ users
  - ✅ roles
  - ✅ customers
  - ✅ orders
  - ✅ invoices
  - ✅ invoice_items
  - ✅ customer_measurements
  - ✅ pages
  - ✅ actions

### 5. Test Your Application
- Your app is running on: http://localhost:3001/
- Check browser console for database test results
- All forms should now work with the database!

## What This Creates

- **9 Database Tables** with proper relationships
- **Sample Data** including users, customers, and orders
- **Indexes** for better performance
- **Row Level Security** for data protection
- **Default Roles** and permissions

## Expected Results

After running the SQL, you should see:
- ✅ "Qurtuba Fashion database tables created successfully!"
- ✅ All tables visible in Table Editor
- ✅ Sample data inserted
- ✅ Your application working with real database

## Troubleshooting

If you get errors:
1. Make sure you're in the correct Supabase project
2. Check that the SQL copied completely
3. Try running the SQL in smaller chunks
4. Check the Supabase logs for specific errors

Your application will work with both Supabase and local fallback, so it should function even if there are issues!
